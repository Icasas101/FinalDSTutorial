    "The issue of police brutality against black people in our country has, of course, been as widely discussed as ever over the last year because of the widespread abundance protests against it all over the country. This issue has by no means only been brought up around this time when many people are reckoning with it, but the ability of social media to spread information and set trends so quickly has given the issue a major spotlight. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the questions we would like to answer are as follows:\n",
    "1. Are police more likely to question, search, and/or take more severe actions against people of color?\n",
    "2. Could gender have an effect on how likely someone is to be questioned/searched?\n",
    "3. Could police be biased against people of certain classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "In an ideal situation, any unfair biases that are discovered by this project will be used to determine a change in or create policy that would correct these unethical discriminatory actions and prompt city officials to put that policy in place. At the moment, we are focusing on New Orleans but a possible expansion, given that the datasets would be accessible, could be to compare the conclusions that we draw to conclusions drawn from other cities’ data."

    "For our Final Tutorial, we have partnered up to analyze a dataset called “Stop and Search (Field Interviews).” It is filled with data regarding instances of people being questioned by the New Orleans Police Department. Some of the information about these interviews includes when and where it happened, the officer conducting the questioning and potential search, a description of the individual being searched including age, gender, race, height and weight, the reason the interview was conducted, actions taken, etc. We plan to analyze this information in such a way that one can use our analysis to learn about any biases that NOPD has, or a lack thereof, and how these biases manifest themselves. We expect to specifically look at relationships between frequencies of interviews and searches and descriptors of the subjects of these interviews and searches as well as the relationships between the severity of the actions taken by the police and the descriptors of the subjects. The dataset provides information about the car that the subject was driving, if they were driving one, which will be another variable that can shed light on biases."
